                Chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, wings)
                Buttermilk
                All-purpose flour
                Paprika
                Garlic powder
                Onion powder

                Vegetable oil for frying
                <br><br>
                Instructions:
                <br>
                Soak the chicken pieces in buttermilk for at least 1 hour, or overnight for better flavor.
                
                In a bowl, mix flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
                
                Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large, deep skillet to 350째F (175째C).
                
                Dredge the soaked chicken pieces in the flour mixture, ensuring an even coating.
                
                Carefully place the coated chicken in the hot oil, frying until golden brown and cooked through. Make sure the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).
                
                Remove the fried chicken and let it drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
                
                Serve hot and enjoy the crispy, succulent goodness of homemade fried chicken.</p1>
